It was as if you had known her all your life.</p><p>Itâ€™s a special gift you have. We were so lucky to find you. We also recognize the amount of effort that you put into crafting and delivering the words for the service. It was the most beautiful service to honour Pat...

<Testimonial content={"<p>We would like to express our appreciation for the compassion and empathy you showed yesterday.  With all that was happening, we were not able to properly thank you for all you did. Hazel's send-off was perfect. In fact, a number of people commented that you must have been a friend of the family and known Hazel yourself!</p><p>Saying goodbye was never going to be easy but your handling of everything from start to finish was warm and yet professional,made it so much easier for us all.</p><p> - Daryll and Anne Lloyd</p>"}></Testimonial>
