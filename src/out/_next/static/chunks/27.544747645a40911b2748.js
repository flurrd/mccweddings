I care about specificity, code style consistency and minimal use of third party code, if any.\n\n\nI leverage every new spec that lands in modern browsers (that a project allows) and love the evolving nature of the technology.\n\nI get pretty excited when new features become usable on production. If there\u2019s a cool spec in the pipeline at WC3, I\u2019ll know about it.\n\nThe last ten years have been awesome. It\u2019s a pleasure to work with modern CSS, front end frameworks and platforms. Every year brings new tools and features. Improvings one\u2019s creative licence when mastered.\nI do most design work directly in the browser and at speed. I believe starting in the browser leads to a more effective design workflow where content structure and grouping is given careful thought before jumping too deep into rendered positioning look/feel work. I create mockups that are working prototypes, which become usable in production and are easy to reconfigure layout and styling.\n\n\nI am a well practiced  graphic artist and photographer. On the extreme I have even done character design and animation work back in the flash game days. I can draw in cartoon and photorealism styles.\n\n\n"}}]);
