## Services & Statement of Rates

A celebrant should cost more than your cake, less than your photographer and be someone whom you feel comfortable and confident with.

#### FULL CEREMONY PACKAGE: $950 + gst

A full ceremony package includes all items below. I am happy to accommodate request of additional services to make your ceremony more personal and memorable. I will supply you with a fixed quote after we agree upon what you want for your wedding and how we can best achieve this.

*   A personalised, heartfelt ceremony.
*   Complimentary use of my portable PA system, that your wedding music can be played through. I would appreciate you nominating someone on the day to coordinate the music.
*   I download your music choices directly into my Itunes account as s complimentary service so you don’t have to worry about putting it on CD or USB! – No fuss!
*   All the legal paperwork completed to register your marriage.
*   Full advice and support to ensure a stress-free and seamless ceremony.
*   A Marriage Certificate presented to you on your Wedding day.  
    (An added extra I offer is for me to order your registered marriage certificate which is a $75 fee including administration costs, sent to your home 5 working days after your ceremony. This is the certificate the Bride needs to change her Surname.)
*   A rehearsal.
*   No charge for Rituals or Blessings, but I will pass on costs that I incur.
*   A 40-hour acknowledgement candle & the use of my Victorian candle stand. I recommend that this is lit at the beginning of your ceremony, inviting loved ones that are unable to be present, to join in on your special day.

There are factors that may cause changes to the above price including; interpreters, extra travel time or long distance, overnight stays and accommodation, translation services, costs associated with special arrangements, hire of specialized equipment or dress required by the couple. There may be other items but all of this will be discussed and negotiated before you need to pay the booking fee.

A well-designed wedding ceremony has a clear structure that flows smoothly, maintains everyone’s interest and remains very personal and intimate throughout. I am committed to providing you with an outstanding quality of service as I work with you to achieve your ideal ceremony. I look forward to being your celebrant and would be honoured to be chosen.
