    Dear Maureen
</p>


    <p>We would like to express our appreciation for the compassion and empathy you showed yesterday.  With all that was happening, we were not able to properly thank you for all you did. Hazel's send-off was perfect. In fact, a number of people commented that you must have been a friend of the family and known Hazel yourself!</p><p>Saying "goodbye" was never going to be easy but your handling of everything from start to finish was warm and yet professional,made it so much easier for us all.</p><p> - Daryll and Anne Lloyd</p>



Maureen,

We can't thank you enough for how much effort you put in and how beautiful you made the day!
