<p>
    A Celebration of Life or Funeral Service can help you say goodbye and thank you to your loved one. 
</p>

<p>
    My service provides warmth, comfort and support by remembering your loved one, and remembering them well! We all need to say good-bye respectfully whilst honouring that spirit that has passed.
</p> 

<p>
    We can do this by paying tributes, acknowledging and focusing on their life, their achievements, beliefs and loves. 
</p>

<p>
    A celebration will be accompanied with beautiful readings and poetry, moving music, honouring words from family and loved ones and symbolism that represents your loved ones life story. 
</p>

<p>
    Together we can create a heart felt, authentic, uplifting and memorable service that reflects the qualities and attributes of your beloved.
